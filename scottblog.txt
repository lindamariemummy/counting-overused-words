For a class I am taking we were given the task to find a less standard nodejs package and implement it into a program. I worked on this project with Linda Mummy and the package we chose is called Word-Freq (https://www.npmjs.org/package/word-freq). It's basic function is to find the number of times a word occurs in a text document. We chose to write a program that returns all words that occur over a user defined percentage of the total word count of the document. Our idea was to give the user a tool to identify problematic word choice in a piece of writing.

Since the overuse of words is a mistake many amateur writers make this is a program that can improve their writing. When we tested the program out the results were expected but still interesting. When we plugged in an example of a typical high school freshmen essay their were words that were used over 6% of the time. However, when we plugged in Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen the only words used more then .1 % of the time were character names a few identifying nouns such as 'father'. It is clear that our program could have helped the freshman to write a better essay.

Currently the program only takes inputs from the console but in the future we hope include an easy to use UX. I imagine our program may have more uses. I am particularly interested to see if it could be used by linguists to analyze and compare languages.
